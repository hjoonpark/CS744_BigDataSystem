## Configuration
Each time new ssh connection is established to the namenode, 
type `hostname` command in each datanode and paste the host name into the
`hosts` file.

Then, re-configure environment variables, connections with datanodes, etc. using:

    source reconfig.sh

After the re-configurations is done, proceed to `part2` or `part3` folders.
